          My name is Aaron Ealdama and I am a current student at the University
          of Texas at Austin's coding Bootcamp at Houston. I am currently a
          self-taught developer who knows basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a
          little bit of jQuery. Currently my dream is to learn different kinds
          of technologies and become a freelance developer so I can become my
          own boss.

          My birthday is December 19th, and my hobbies include building puzzles
          and solving Rubik's cubes. I also love to sing. I may not look like
          it, but I was born in Detroit, Michigan and I still proudly call it my
          home (sorry Houston). My motto is simple: you name and I'll build it!
          So if you ever need an amazing website to be built or want someone
          cool to hang out with, I'm your guy.
